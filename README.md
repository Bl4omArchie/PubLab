# Welcome to the Lab

I'm managing my github in Project and Laboratory: this Lab is about experiment on my librairy pubcrypt. I'm testing stuff before pushing them in the real repo. (see publab)
Also I'm trying to improve the librairy with multi-thread and multi-processing programmation. (see pylab)

You also can find the papers I'm using to create my librairy (study_paper). And the notebooks I'm writting (see paperwork)

Everything in there is under developpement and I will often do some new commit.
